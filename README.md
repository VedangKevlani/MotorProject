Road safety is everyone's responsibility. Even the most experienced drivers become forgetful or complacent and make decisions that place their safety and the safety of adjacent or oncoming traffic at risk. This web project is designed to help prepare, and practice road theory with the ultimate goal of minimizing road hazards.
